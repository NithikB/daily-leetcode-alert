# daily-leetcode-alert

### Inspiration
I wanted to practice at least one LeetCode question a day to improve my skills, but I would often forget or wouldn't select a truly random question. So, I wanted to create something to remove variability by providing me with a question and help remind me and my friends to do a question a day. (A question a day keeps the interview fears away.)
